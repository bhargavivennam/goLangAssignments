How do computers read code..
When we write a program it is saved into program file in the hard disk. For example when we write some 
code in the vscode it gets saved into hard drive. The compiler converts human readable code to machine 
understandable language. It converts the english letters code to binary code which is series of 0's and 
1's. For computer the programming code is meaningless sequence of characters. When we pass it to the 
computer, it first divides into individual tokens called Lexical analysis. Then the tokens are organised 
into hierarchical structure i.e. parse tree called syntactic analysis. Then we traverse the tree and find 
out machine code similar to source code. It converts the code into hexadecimal form and then assembly 
language. In assembly we have block code, instructions to evaluate program and jumps. Compilers convert 
source code to machine code. It is better if we keep an executable for every single platform. CPU will 
use binary format and do the processing and it sends back to operating system. It will print the output 
on the monitor.
